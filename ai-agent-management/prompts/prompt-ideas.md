<!-- Brainstorm Prompts Ideas Here  -->

# Random Prompt Snippets

- Reflect on quality and relevance: After receiving results/feedback/report/review, carefully reflect on the quality and relevance then determine optimal next steps before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.

- Be task-specific: Design evals that mirror your real-world task distribution. Don‚Äôt forget to factor in edge cases!
  
- Automate when possible: Structure questions to allow for automated grading (e.g., multiple-choice, string match, code-graded, LLM-graded).

- Prioritize volume over quality: More questions with slightly lower signal automated grading is better than fewer questions with high-quality human hand-graded evals

- Define success criteria: Provide A clear definition of the success criteria for your use case.

- Some ways to empirically test against those criteria. Prompt optimization should be focused on achieving specific, measurable goals. 
-- Specific: Clearly define what you want to achieve. Instead of 'good performance,' specify 'accurate user sentiments.'
-- Measurable: Specify the measurable criteria for success. For example, 'The model should have an accuracy of at least 80%.'

- Achievable 


- A first draft prompt you want to improve


# Over-Engineering 
--avoid a solution that is unnecessarily complex, where it provides no real value and increases complexity, time, and resources without a corresponding benefit
-- avoid unecessary complexity: Over-engineering introduces more layers, features, or processes than are actually required to solve the problem. 
-- Avoid Premature Optimization: Don't optimize for future scenarios or scale that are not yet needed, leading to wasted effort and potential errors.
-- Lack of Value: more complexity doesn't bring a significant benefit, often making the product more difficult to maintain and less user-friendly.
-- Violation of Principles: principles like "less is more," "KISS" (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and value engineering.

# Preventing Over-Engineering
-- Focus on the core problem: Identify the specific problem you're trying to solve and avoid adding unnecessary features or complexity. 
-- Prioritize simplicity: Choose the simplest solution that meets the requirements, avoiding premature optimization.  
-- Use the KISS principle: Keep it simple, stupid. 
-- Embrace minimalism: Favor a "less is more" approach in design and development. 

# Consistancy
-- Consistency is key in design and development. Ensure that the design and implementation are consistent with each other, and that the final product is easy to use and understand.

# Be clear, contextual, and specific
-- More context is better
-- Ask yourself the following questions to build contextual information:
---- What the feature will be used for
---- What the target audience is
---- What workflow the task is a part of, and where this task belongs in that workflow
---- The end goal of the task, or what a successful task completion looks like
-- Be specific and clear: if you want to output only code and nothing else, say so
-- Provide instructions as sequential steps: Use numbered lists or bullet points to better ensure that Claude carries out the task the exact way you want it to.

# Use Examples
- Accuracy: Examples reduce misinterpretation of instructions.
- Consistency: Examples enforce uniform structure and style.
- Performance: Well-chosen examples boost models ability to handle complex tasks.
- Relevant: Your examples mirror your actual use case.
- 
- Include 3-5 diverse, relevant examples to show the model exactly what you want. More examples = better performance, especially for complex tasks.
- - Relevant: Your examples mirror your actual use case.
- - Diverse: Your examples cover edge cases and potential challenges, and vary enough that Claude doesn‚Äôt inadvertently pick up on unintended patterns.
- - Clear: Your examples are wrapped in <example> tags (if multiple, nested within <examples> tags) for structure
  ** Ask a model to evaluate your examples for relevance, diversity, or clarity. Or have the model generate more examples based on your initial set **

# Tags
  -Use tags like <instructions>, <example>, and <formatting> to clearly separate different parts of your prompt. This prevents Claude from mixing up instructions with examples or context.

# Roles
  - Enhanced accuracy: In complex scenarios like legal analysis or financial modeling, QA and engineer, role prompting can significantly boost performance.
  - Tailored tone: Whether you need a CFO‚Äôs brevity or a copywriter‚Äôs flair, role prompting adjusts communication style.
  - Improved focus: By setting the role context, agent stays more within the bounds of your task‚Äôs specific requirements.
  - Reinforce with prefilled responses: Prefill the model responses with a character tag to reinforce its role, especially in long conversations.

# Debugging
  - if agent misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.
  - You can use agents thinking output to debug agents logic, although this method is not always perfectly reliable.
  
# Chain Prompting
  - Each link in the chain gets agents full attention!
  - Identify subtasks: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
  - Structure with XML for clear handoffs: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.
  - Have a single-task goal: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.
  - Iterate: Refine subtasks based on Claude‚Äôs performance.
  
# Advanced: Self-correction chains
  - chain prompts to have different agents review each other‚Äôs work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks. 
  - Ask agent to verify its work with a simple test before declaring a task complete
  - Instruct the model to analyze whether its previous step achieved the expected result
  - For coding tasks, ask agent to run through test cases in its extended thinking
  - Chain-of-thought verification: Ask agent to explain its reasoning step-by-step before giving a final answer. This can reveal faulty logic or assumptions.
  - Best-of-N verficiation: Run the model through the same prompt multiple times and compare the outputs. Inconsistencies across outputs could indicate hallucinations.
  - Iterative refinement: Use Claude‚Äôs outputs as inputs for follow-up prompts, asking it to verify or expand on previous statements. This can catch and correct inconsistencies.
  - External knowledge restriction: Explicitly instruct Claude to only use information from provided documents and not its general knowledge.


# Extended Thinking
  - Use general instructions first, then troubleshoot with more step-by-step instructions
  - Provide high level instructions to just think deeply about a task rather than step-by-step prescriptive guidance. The model‚Äôs creativity in approaching problems may exceed a human‚Äôs ability to prescribe the optimal thinking process.
  - ask specifically for exteneded thinking AND explicitly ask for longer outputs.

# Second-grade simplifier
  - Make complex code easy for young learners to understand.
  - Your task is to take the text provided and rewrite it in a way that is easy for young learners in grades 3-5 to read and understand. Simplify advanced vocabulary, break down long sentences, explain difficult concepts in plain language, and present the information in a clear, engaging way. The short rewritten text should convey the core ideas of the original text in an age-appropriate manner.
