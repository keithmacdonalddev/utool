**Date:** 2025-06-04
**Reviewed By:** Cascade AI (QA Expert Role)

## I. Executive Summary (To be completed after full review)

## II. Detailed File Reviews

This section provides a detailed review of each new component and significant changes introduced in Milestone 2.

### A. Atomic Components

#### 1. `client/src/components/projects/atoms/TaskBadge.js`

-   **Purpose & Design:**
    -   Serves as an atomic unit for displaying task status, priority, or type.
    -   Accepts `variant` (`status`, `priority`, `type`), `value`, `size`, `className`, and `children` props.
-   **Styling & Variants:**
    -   Utilizes `cn` utility for conditional class names.
    -   Comprehensive and distinct Tailwind CSS color schemes (background, text, ring) for each variant and value (e.g., `status: todo, in-progress`; `priority: low, medium`; `type: task, bug`).
    -   Provides a sensible default gray color scheme for unrecognized inputs.
    -   Clear sizing variations (`sm`, `md`, `lg`).
-   **Display Logic:**
    -   Renders `children` if provided.
    -   Otherwise, formats the `value` prop for display (e.g., 'in-progress' becomes 'In Progress').
-   **JSDoc & Readability:**
    -   Clear JSDoc comments for props and purpose.
    -   Logical and easy-to-follow code structure.
-   **Utility Functions:**
    -   Exports `getStatusColor` and `getPriorityColor` which return generic color names (e.g., "blue"). These are useful for UI elements outside direct Tailwind class application.
-   **Areas for Consideration/Minor Improvements:**
    -   **PropTypes:** Consider adding runtime `PropTypes` for enhanced development-time validation, consistent with other project components.
    -   **Accessibility (A11y):** Color contrast appears generally good (spot-checked). Textual content is inherently accessible.
-   **Conclusion:** A well-implemented, reusable, and visually consistent atomic component. Effectively meets its design goals.
    -   **Recommendation:** Add `PropTypes`.

#### 2. `client/src/components/projects/atoms/UserAvatar.js`

-   **Purpose & Design:**
    -   Displays user avatars, either from an image URL or as initials with a generated background color.
    -   Accepts `user` object (with `name`, `email`, `avatar`), `size` (`xs`-`xl`), `showName` (boolean).
    -   Returns `null` if no `user` prop is provided.
-   **Styling & Sizing:**
    -   Uses `cn` utility. Clear sizing definitions.
-   **Initials Generation:**
    -   `getInitials(name)`: Standard and effective generation (up to 2 chars, uppercase, '?' fallback).
-   **Background Color Generation:**
    -   `getBackgroundColor(name)`: Uses a predefined array of Tailwind colors and a simple hash of the name to ensure consistent color per user. `bg-gray-400` fallback.
-   **Avatar Content Logic:**
    -   Prioritizes `user.avatar` image if available.
    -   Falls back to initials on a colored background.
-   **Displaying Name:**
    -   If `showName` is true, displays avatar + name (or email fallback) with truncation for long names.
    -   If `showName` is false, avatar includes a `title` attribute for hover tooltip.
-   **JSDoc & Readability:**
    -   Good JSDoc comments. Well-structured code.
-   **Areas for Consideration/Minor Improvements:**
    -   **PropTypes:** Recommend adding runtime `PropTypes` for `user` object structure and other props.
    -   **Accessibility (A11y) - Color Contrast:** The `text-white` for initials against some lighter background colors in the palette (e.g., `bg-yellow-400`) may not meet WCAG AA contrast. Needs review.
    -   **Image Error Handling:** Consider an `onError` handler for the `<img>` tag to fall back to initials if the avatar image fails to load.
-   **Conclusion:** A well-designed and robust component for user avatars. Initials and background color generation are good features.
    -   **Key Recommendations:**
        1.  Add `PropTypes`.
        2.  Review/adjust background color palette or text color for initials to ensure WCAG AA contrast (especially for lighter backgrounds like yellow).
        3.  Consider adding an `onError` image fallback.

### B. Molecule Components

#### 1. `client/src/components/projects/molecules/TaskCard.js`

-   **Purpose & Design:**
    -   Displays individual task information in a card format, suitable for lists or Kanban boards.
    -   Accepts `task` object, `isDragging` state, various click handlers (`onTaskClick`, `onMenuClick`, `onTimeToggle`, `onStatusChange`), and `...dragProps`.
    -   Manages local state `isTimeTracking`.
-   **Event Handling:**
    -   `handleCardClick`: Calls `onTaskClick`, smartly prevents propagation from interactive inner elements.
    -   `handleTimeToggle`, `handleMenuClick`: Call respective callbacks and stop propagation.
-   **Visual Indicators & Information Display:**
    -   **Priority Indicator (`getPriorityIndicator`):** Icon for 'urgent', dot for 'high'.
    -   **Progress (`getProgress`):** Calculates and displays progress for subtasks (bar and text).
    -   **Header:** Priority indicator, title (line-clamped), description (line-clamped), Time Tracking button (Play/Pause), Menu button.
    -   **Badges:** Uses `TaskBadge` for status; conditional display for priority (not 'medium') and type (not 'task').
    -   **Metadata Footer:**
        -   **Due Date:** `Calendar` icon, relative formatting (`formatDistanceToNow`), highlights if overdue and not done.
        -   **Assignees:** `Users` icon, displays count of assignees. `UserAvatar` is imported but not explicitly used in the provided code for displaying multiple avatars in the footer (might be intended for a tooltip or a different section if assignees are clicked).
        -   **Comments:** `MessageSquare` icon, displays `task.comments?.length`.
        -   **Attachments:** `Paperclip` icon, displays `task.attachments?.length`.
        -   **Subtasks:** `CheckSquare` icon, displays `task.subtasks?.length`.
-   **Styling & Drag State:**
    -   Clean base styling with hover effects. `isDragging` state provides clear visual feedback (opacity, rotation).
-   **JSDoc & Readability:**
    -   Good JSDoc. Well-structured with helper functions.
-   **Areas for Consideration/Minor Improvements:**
    -   **PropTypes:** Crucial for this complex component; should validate `task` structure and function props.
    -   **`useDispatch`:** Imported but not used in the component code. Should be removed if truly unused.
    -   **Time Tracking State (`isTimeTracking`):** Local state initialized from `task.timeTracking?.isActive`. May become stale if the `task` prop updates externally. Consider deriving directly or using `useEffect` for synchronization.
    -   **Accessibility (A11y):** Buttons have `title` attributes. Ensure keyboard accessibility for the main card click. Review color contrasts.
    -   **Magic Strings:** Consider using constants for status, priority, and type strings (e.g., `TASK_STATUSES.DONE`).
    -   **Assignee Display:** The `UserAvatar` import suggests a more detailed assignee display might be intended than just a count. If avatars are to be shown in the card footer (common pattern), this part of the implementation is missing or elsewhere.
-   **Conclusion:** A feature-rich and well-structured component for displaying task information. Event handling and visual presentation are generally strong.
    -   **Key Recommendations:**
        1.  **Add comprehensive `PropTypes`**.
        2.  Clarify/remove unused `useDispatch`.
        3.  Refactor `isTimeTracking` state management for robustness against prop updates.
        4.  Conduct thorough A11y review (keyboard navigation, color contrasts).
        5.  Consider constants for magic strings.
        6.  Clarify/implement intended assignee display using `UserAvatar` if more than a count is desired in the card footer.

#### 2. `client/src/components/projects/molecules/TaskColumn.js`

-   **Purpose & Design:**
    -   Represents a Kanban column, displaying header (title, task count, WIP limit) and a list of tasks.
    -   Integrates drag-and-drop using `@dnd-kit/core` and `@dnd-kit/sortable`.
    -   Props: `column` (object), `tasks` (array), various event handlers.
-   **Drag-and-Drop (DnD) Integration:**
    -   **Droppable Column:** Uses `useDroppable`. `canDrop` logic correctly restricts drops to 'task' types. Visual feedback for `isOver` and `canDrop` states.
    -   **Sortable Tasks:** Uses `SortableContext` with `verticalListSortingStrategy` for tasks within the column.
    -   **`SortableTaskCard` Wrapper:** Encapsulates `useSortable` logic for individual task cards, applying styles for drag animations and passing `isDragging` state.
-   **Column Header:**
    -   Displays column color indicator, name, task count, and WIP limit (highlighted if exceeded).
    -   Action buttons: "Add Task" and "Column Menu" with appropriate icons and handlers.
-   **Column Content Area:**
    -   **WIP Limit Warning:** Prominent visual warning if WIP limit is exceeded.
    -   **Tasks List:** Renders `SortableTaskCard` for each task.
    -   **Empty State:** Clear and helpful message with an icon when no tasks are present.
    -   **Drop Zone Indicator:** Overlay with "Drop task here" text for clear drop feedback.
-   **Styling & Readability:**
    -   Well-structured code. `SortableTaskCard` separation is clean. Visual cues are user-friendly.
-   **JSDoc:** Good JSDoc for `TaskColumn` and `SortableTaskCard`.
-   **Areas for Consideration/Minor Improvements:**
    -   **PropTypes:** Essential for `column`, `tasks`, and function props.
    -   **Performance:** For very large task lists, consider virtualization (future scaling).
    -   **Accessibility (A11y):** Drag-and-drop needs thorough testing for keyboard-only users and screen reader announcements. Verify color contrasts.
    -   **Column Color Usage:** Ensure `column.color` provides good contrast if used with text or for critical differentiation.
-   **Conclusion:** A well-implemented core component for Kanban functionality. DnD integration is robust with good visual feedback. UI for WIP limits and empty states is user-friendly.
    -   **Key Recommendations:**
        1.  **Add comprehensive `PropTypes`**.
        2.  **Prioritize A11y testing for DnD interactions** (keyboard, screen readers).
        3.  Verify color contrasts.

### C. Organism Components

#### 1. `client/src/components/projects/organisms/TaskBoard.js`

-   **Purpose & Design:**
    -   Main Kanban board orchestrator, fetching data from Redux, managing DnD context, and providing board-level UI (search, filter, settings).
    -   Props: `projectId`, `onTaskClick`, `onAddTask`.
-   **Redux Integration:**
    -   Uses `taskSlice` selectors (`selectFilteredTasks`, `selectBoardColumns`) and actions (`updateTaskStatus`, `startTimeTracking`, `stopTimeTracking`). `reorderTasks` is imported.
    -   Handles `isLoading` and `error` states from Redux.
-   **Local State:** `activeTask` (for drag overlay), `searchQuery`, `showFilters`, `showSettings`.
-   **Drag-and-Drop (DnD) Setup:**
    -   `DndContext` with `PointerSensor` (activation distance) and `KeyboardSensor` (`sortableKeyboardCoordinates`).
    -   `DragOverlay` renders `TaskCard` for `activeTask`.
    -   `handleDragStart`: Sets `activeTask`.
    -   `handleDragEnd`: Clears `activeTask`. Dispatches `updateTaskStatus` for inter-column moves.
    -   `handleDragOver`: Currently a placeholder.
    -   **Critical Missing Feature: Intra-Column Reordering.** Logic to handle reordering tasks within the same column (e.g., dispatching `reorderTasks`) is absent in `handleDragEnd` or `handleDragOver`.
-   **Task & Column Data:**
    -   `tasksByColumn`: `useMemo` hook correctly groups tasks by column ID (status).
-   **Event Handlers (Placeholders):**
    -   `handleTaskMenu`, `handleColumnMenu`: `console.log` stubs.
    -   `handleSearchChange`: Updates `searchQuery` state; filtering logic noted as TODO.
-   **UI Structure:**
    -   **Board Header:** Title, Search input, Filter toggle button, Settings toggle button.
    -   **Filters Panel (`showFilters`):** UI for assignee, priority, type dropdowns (static options, no filtering action dispatch). "Clear filters" hides panel.
    -   **Board Content:** Renders `TaskColumn` components in a horizontally scrollable area. `DndContext` correctly wraps this.
    -   **Loading/Error/Empty States:** Well-handled UI for these states.
-   **Areas for Consideration/Minor Improvements:**
    -   **PropTypes:** Essential.
    -   **Intra-Column Task Reordering:** Needs implementation in `handleDragEnd` or `handleDragOver` using the imported `reorderTasks` action and potentially `arrayMove` utility.
    -   **Filter & Search Logic:** Connect UI to Redux state/actions for actual filtering.
    -   **Menu Implementations:** Develop actual dropdown/modal menus for task and column actions.
    -   **Board Settings:** Implement settings panel and functionality.
    -   **Loading State Usage:** `isLoading` is handled with an overlay, which is good.
-   **Conclusion:** A strong architectural foundation for the Kanban board with excellent DnD setup for inter-column moves and good Redux integration. UI for columns, tasks, and board states is well-handled.
    -   **Critical Missing Functionality:** Intra-column task reordering.
    -   **Incomplete Features:** Filtering, search, task/column menus, board settings.
    -   **Key Recommendations:**
        1.  **Implement intra-column task reordering logic** (likely in `handleDragEnd` or `handleDragOver` by dispatching `reorderTasks`).
        2.  **Add comprehensive `PropTypes`**.
        3.  Connect filter UI to Redux actions and implement search logic.
        4.  Develop task/column menu functionality.
        5.  Implement board settings functionality.

#### 2. `client/src/components/projects/organisms/TaskListView.js`

-   **Purpose & Design:**
    -   Offers a comprehensive table/list view for tasks, including sorting, filtering, bulk operations.
    -   Props: `projectId`, `onTaskClick`, `onAddTask`.
-   **Redux Integration:**
    -   Uses `taskSlice` selectors and actions (`selectFilteredTasks`, `setTaskFilters`, `bulkUpdateTasks`, `startTimeTracking`, `stopTimeTracking`). 
    -   Handles `isLoading` and `error` states.
-   **Local State:** `sortConfig`, `showFilters`, `searchQuery`, `selectedRows` (Set for UI selection), `showBulkActions`.
-   **Sorting & Filtering:**
    -   `handleSort` and `sortedTasks` (`useMemo`): Robust multi-type column sorting (dates, strings, numbers).
    -   `searchQuery` and `filteredTasks` (`useMemo`): Client-side search on title, description, assignee name.
    -   Filter UI (`showFilters` panel) with dropdowns for priority, type, assignee (assignee options TODO). `handleFilterChange` dispatches `setTaskFilters` correctly.
-   **Row Selection & Bulk Actions:**
    -   `handleRowSelect`, `handleSelectAll` manage `selectedRows` Set.
    -   Bulk Actions dropdown (toggle with `showBulkActions`): "Change Status" (dispatches `bulkUpdateTasks`), "Delete Selected" (placeholder `console.log`).
-   **`TaskRow` Inner Component:**
    -   Renders individual table rows with checkbox, title/description, status/priority badges, assignee avatar, formatted due date (overdue highlighted), subtask progress bar, time tracking info, last updated time, and action buttons (time toggle, placeholder "More Actions").
-   **UI & UX:**
    -   Clear table headers with sort indicators.
    -   Good visual feedback for selected rows, loading states (overlay spinner), error messages, and various empty states (no tasks at all, or no tasks matching filters).
-   **Areas for Completion/Improvement:**
    1.  **PropTypes:** Essential.
    2.  **Bulk Delete:** Implement functionality for "Delete Selected".
    3.  **Individual Task Actions Menu:** Implement "More Actions" menu for rows.
    4.  **Inline Editing:** JSDoc mentions it, but no implementation visible. If required, this is a significant feature to add.
    5.  **Redux `selectedTasks` vs. Local `selectedRows`:** Clarify synchronization or purpose of Redux `selectedTasks` if local `selectedRows` drives UI and bulk actions.
    6.  **Assignee Filter Options:** Populate assignee dropdown in filter panel.
-   **Conclusion:** A very comprehensive and well-implemented table view for tasks. Strong on sorting, searching, bulk status updates, and UI feedback. Key remaining items are bulk delete, individual row actions, and potentially inline editing.
    -   **Key Recommendations:**
        1.  Implement Bulk Delete and Individual Task Actions.
        2.  Add `PropTypes`.
        3.  Clarify/sync Redux `selectedTasks` if necessary.
        4.  If inline editing is a requirement, plan and implement this feature.
        5.  Populate assignee filter options.

## III. Redux State Management (`client/src/features/tasks/taskSlice.js` - Inferred Review)

**Note:** Direct file access was prevented due to `.gitignore` rules. This review is based on component interactions and QA prompt information.

-   **Expected State Structure (Inferred):**
    -   `tasks`: Array of task objects.
    -   `boardColumns`: Array of column configurations.
    -   `isLoading`, `error`: For data fetching state.
    -   `taskFilters`: Object for filter criteria (priority, assignee, etc.).
    -   `selectedTasks`: Array of selected task IDs (role vs. local component selection needs clarity).
-   **Implemented Actions & Reducers (Inferred):**
    -   `fetchTasks` (or similar async thunk): Implied for loading initial data.
    -   `updateTaskStatus({ taskId, status })`: Handles inter-column task moves.
    -   `reorderTasks({...})`: **Imported by `TaskBoard.js` but NOT USED/DISPATCHED.** This is a critical gap for intra-column reordering.
    -   `startTimeTracking({ taskId })`, `stopTimeTracking({ taskId })`: For time tracking feature.
    -   `setTaskFilters({ filterType, value })`: Updates filter criteria in Redux state.
    -   `bulkUpdateTasks({ taskIds, updates })`: For bulk operations like changing status.
    -   `setBulkSelection({ taskIds })`: Imported, but usage pattern with local UI selection is unclear.
-   **Selectors (Inferred):**
    -   `selectFilteredTasks`: Crucial selector, expected to apply filters from `state.tasks.taskFilters` to the `tasks` array.
    -   `selectBoardColumns`: Provides column configurations for the `TaskBoard`.
    -   Selectors for `isLoading`, `error`, `taskFilters`, `selectedTasks`.
-   **Areas for Concern / Questions (Based on Inferred Logic):**
    1.  **Intra-Column Reordering (`reorderTasks`):** The action is defined but not dispatched from `TaskBoard.js`. This means drag-and-drop reordering of tasks within a column is likely non-functional.
    2.  **Source of Truth for Task Order:** How is task order within columns maintained and updated by `reorderTasks` reducer?
    3.  **`selectFilteredTasks` Completeness:** Does it robustly apply all intended filter types (priority, type, assignee, dates)?
    4.  **`selectedTasks` (Redux) vs. Local Selection:** Clarify the role and synchronization of `state.tasks.selectedTasks` if components use local state for selection UI.
    5.  **Optimistic Updates:** Are they used for smoother UX on mutations?
-   **Conclusion (Inferred):**
    -   The slice likely supports key data management for tasks, columns, and filtering criteria.
    -   **Major Gap:** The non-implementation of `reorderTasks` dispatch in `TaskBoard.js` is a critical issue for core Kanban functionality.
-   **Key Recommendations (Based on Inferred Logic):**
    1.  **Implement `reorderTasks` dispatch in `TaskBoard.js`** for intra-column drag-and-drop.
    2.  Verify the `reorderTasks` reducer logic correctly updates task order.
    3.  Ensure `selectFilteredTasks` comprehensively applies all defined filters.
    4.  Clarify and synchronize `selectedTasks` Redux state with UI selection mechanisms if necessary.
    5.  Consider optimistic updates for task mutations.

## IV. Drag and Drop Functionality (`@dnd-kit`)

Review of drag and drop functionality primarily within `TaskBoard.js` (DndContext, sensors, collision detection, `handleDragEnd` for inter-column moves) and `TaskColumn.js` (droppable areas, sortable items using `useSortable`).

-   **Inter-Column Task Movement (Status Change):**
    -   Successfully implemented in `TaskBoard.js`'s `handleDragEnd`.
    -   When a task is dropped into a different column, its `status` is correctly updated by dispatching `updateTaskStatus`.
    -   Visual feedback during drag (e.g., opacity change of dragged item) is good.
    -   Drop zones in `TaskColumn.js` are clearly indicated when a task is dragged over them.
-   **Intra-Column Task Reordering:**
    -   **CRITICAL GAP:** This functionality is **MISSING**. While `TaskBoard.js` imports `reorderTasks` action and `arrayMove` utility, the `handleDragEnd` logic (or `handleDragOver` if intended for live reordering) does not implement the case where `active.data.current.sortable.containerId === over.data.current.sortable.containerId` (i.e., task dropped in the same column).
    -   The `useSortable` hook is correctly applied to `TaskCard` instances within `TaskColumn.js`, and `@dnd-kit/sortable` provides the necessary infrastructure, but the final step of dispatching an action to update the task order in Redux state for the specific column is not implemented.
-   **Drag Handles & Sensors:**
    -   Uses `PointerSensor` and `KeyboardSensor`. Keyboard navigation for DnD (e.g., using spacebar to lift, arrow keys to move, spacebar to drop) is a good accessibility practice provided by `@dnd-kit` and seems to be set up.
    -   It's not explicitly clear if a dedicated drag handle is used on `TaskCard.js` or if the entire card is draggable. If the entire card is draggable, ensure interactive elements on the card (buttons, links) are still easily clickable and don't conflict with drag initiation.
-   **Visual Feedback:**
    -   `TaskColumn.js` provides good visual cues for drop zones and when WIP limits are approached or exceeded.
    -   Dragged items (`TaskCard.js`) have appropriate styling changes (e.g., `isDragging` prop styling).
-   **Collision Detection:**
    -   `TaskBoard.js` uses `closestCorners` collision detection strategy, which is generally suitable for Kanban-style boards.
-   **Accessibility:**
    -   The use of `KeyboardSensor` is a good start. Thorough testing of keyboard-only drag and drop operations is recommended to ensure full accessibility compliance (e.g., clear focus indicators, announcements for screen readers if possible via ARIA live regions or similar techniques for drag start/drop events).
-   **Conclusion:**
    -   Inter-column drag and drop for status changes is functional and well-implemented.
    -   The **absence of intra-column task reordering is a major deficiency** for an advanced task management system and a core aspect of Kanban board usability.
    -   Accessibility setup is promising but needs thorough testing.
-   **Key Recommendations:**
    1.  **CRITICAL: Implement intra-column task reordering logic** in `TaskBoard.js`'s `handleDragEnd` (or `handleDragOver`) by dispatching the `reorderTasks` action with the correct payload (column ID, old index, new index).
    2.  Verify that interactive elements on `TaskCard.js` are not hindered by the drag functionality if the entire card is the drag target.
    3.  Conduct comprehensive accessibility testing for keyboard-based drag and drop operations and screen reader compatibility.

## V. Code Quality, Comments, and Best Practices

Overall assessment of code quality based on reviewed components (`TaskBadge.js`, `UserAvatar.js`, `TaskCard.js`, `TaskColumn.js`, `TaskBoard.js`, `TaskListView.js`).

-   **Modularity and Component Design:**
    -   Good adherence to Atomic Design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms) helps in organizing UI components logically (`TaskBadge`, `UserAvatar` as atoms; `TaskCard`, `TaskColumn` as molecules; `TaskBoard`, `TaskListView` as organisms).
    -   Components are generally focused on their specific responsibilities.
    -   Use of React functional components and hooks is consistent.
-   **Readability and Naming:**
    -   Variable and function names are generally descriptive and follow `camelCase` conventions.
    -   Component names use `PascalCase`.
    -   Code is well-formatted (likely aided by Prettier), making it easy to read.
-   **React Best Practices:**
    -   `useCallback` is used for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders, especially in `TaskListView.js`.
    -   `useMemo` is used for derived data (e.g., `sortedTasks`, `filteredTasks` in `TaskListView.js`), which is good for performance optimization.
    -   State management combines local component state (`useState`) for UI-specific concerns and Redux for global/shared application state.
    -   Props are destructured in component signatures.
-   **Comments and Documentation:**
    -   JSDoc-style comments are present for main components (`TaskBoard.js`, `TaskListView.js`), explaining their purpose. This is good.
    -   Inline comments are used sparingly, typically where needed.
    -   **Area for Improvement:** While component-level comments are good, more detailed JSDoc for props (especially for complex objects) and for non-trivial utility functions or complex logic blocks within components would enhance maintainability. The user's instructions emphasize very detailed comments, as if teaching a beginner, and this level of detail is not consistently met for all functions/props.
-   **PropTypes / Type Checking:**
    -   **MAJOR GAP:** Runtime `PropTypes` are consistently missing across all reviewed components. While some components have comments indicating expected prop shapes (e.g., `TaskBadge.js`), these are not enforced at runtime. Adding `PropTypes` is crucial for catching prop-related errors during development and for self-documentation.
-   **Error Handling:**
    -   Loading and error states from Redux (`isLoading`, `error`) are handled in `TaskBoard.js` and `TaskListView.js` to provide user feedback (e.g., loading spinners, error messages). This is good.
    -   Error handling for specific operations (e.g., image load errors in `UserAvatar.js`) was noted as an area for improvement.
-   **CSS and Styling:**
    -   Consistent use of Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
    -   `cn` utility function is used for conditional class name concatenation, which is a good practice.
-   **Accessibility (A11y):**
    -   Basic accessibility considerations are present (e.g., `KeyboardSensor` for DnD, some ARIA attributes implied by library usage).
    -   However, specific recommendations were made for several components regarding color contrast (`TaskBadge`, `UserAvatar`), explicit ARIA attributes, and thorough keyboard navigation testing, especially for drag-and-drop.
-   **Redux Usage:**
    -   Redux Toolkit patterns (slices, `createSlice`, `createAsyncThunk` - inferred) are generally followed.
    -   Selectors are used to derive state in components.
    -   Actions are dispatched for state mutations.
-   **Code Duplication:**
    -   Minimal code duplication observed in the reviewed frontend components. Logic is generally well-encapsulated.
-   **Conclusion:**
    -   The overall code quality is good, with a well-organized component structure and adherence to many React best practices.
    -   The most significant and consistent omission is the lack of runtime `PropTypes` for components.
    -   Commenting, while present at a high level, could be more detailed for props and complex internal logic as per user instructions.
    -   Accessibility needs more focused attention and testing.
-   **Key Recommendations:**
    1.  **CRITICAL: Implement runtime `PropTypes` for all components** to improve development-time validation and documentation.
    2.  Enhance JSDoc comments for props, complex functions, and utility functions to meet the specified detail level.
    3.  Address specific accessibility recommendations made for individual components (color contrast, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation testing).
    4.  Ensure graceful error handling for operations like image loading.

## VI. Final Summary and Overall Recommendations (Milestone 2)

This QA review for Milestone 2 (Advanced Task Management System) covered new frontend components (atomic, molecule, organism), Redux state management for tasks (inferred due to access restrictions), drag-and-drop functionality, and overall code quality. The system demonstrates significant progress towards an advanced task management solution, but several critical gaps and areas for improvement remain.

**Key Strengths:**

1.  **Component Architecture:** Good adherence to Atomic Design principles, leading to a modular and understandable frontend structure.
2.  **`TaskListView.js`:** A well-developed component offering robust sorting, searching, bulk status updates, and a clear table-based UI for tasks.
3.  **Inter-Column Drag & Drop:** Moving tasks between columns (changing status) on the `TaskBoard.js` is functional.
4.  **UI/UX Basics:** Generally good visual feedback for loading, errors, empty states, and interactive elements.
5.  **Code Quality Foundation:** Code is generally readable, well-formatted, and utilizes React best practices like `useMemo` and `useCallback`. Styling with Tailwind CSS is consistent.

**Critical Gaps & High-Priority Issues:**

1.  **Intra-Column Task Reordering (DnD):** This core Kanban functionality is **MISSING** in `TaskBoard.js`. The `reorderTasks` Redux action is defined (inferred) but not dispatched when a task is dragged and dropped within the same column.
2.  **Runtime `PropTypes`:** Consistently **ABSENT** across all reviewed components. This is crucial for development-time validation and component documentation.
3.  **Placeholder Functionality:** Several UI elements are placeholders and not fully implemented:
    -   `TaskBoard.js`: Filter/search UI not fully connected to logic (though `TaskListView` has better filter connection), task/column menus, and board settings.
    -   `TaskListView.js`: "Delete Selected" in bulk actions, "More Actions" menu on individual task rows.

**Medium-Priority Issues & General Recommendations:**

1.  **Accessibility (A11y):** While basic setup for DnD keyboard interaction exists, comprehensive testing and improvements are needed (color contrast on `TaskBadge`, `UserAvatar`; ARIA attributes; full keyboard navigation for DnD).
2.  **Detailed Comments:** While component-level JSDoc exists, prop-level and complex logic block comments need to be more detailed, aligning with user instructions to explain concepts thoroughly.
3.  **Redux `taskSlice.js` (Inferred):**
    -   Verify the `reorderTasks` reducer logic.
    -   Ensure `selectFilteredTasks` selector is comprehensive for all filter types.
    -   Clarify the role and synchronization of `selectedTasks` in Redux state versus local component selection state.
4.  **Error Handling Details:** Enhance specific error handling (e.g., image load errors in `UserAvatar.js`).
5.  **Filter Panel Completeness:** Populate dynamic filter options (e.g., assignee list in `TaskListView.js` filter panel).
6.  **Inline Editing:** If `TaskListView.js`'s JSDoc mention of "inline editing" is a requirement, this feature needs to be designed and implemented.

**Overall Assessment:**

Milestone 2 has successfully introduced several advanced task management features and a more complex UI. The `TaskListView` is a highlight in terms of completeness for its specific view type. However, the critical gap in intra-column drag-and-drop reordering on the `TaskBoard` significantly impacts core Kanban usability. The lack of `PropTypes` is a pervasive issue affecting development robustness.

**Final Recommendations for Milestone Approval (Conditional):**

Approval of Milestone 2 should be **conditional** upon addressing the following CRITICAL issues:

1.  **Implement Intra-Column Task Reordering:** Ensure tasks can be reordered within their respective columns on the `TaskBoard.js` via drag-and-drop, correctly updating the Redux state.
2.  **Implement Runtime `PropTypes`:** Add `PropTypes` to all new and modified components reviewed in this milestone.

Addressing the medium-priority issues is highly recommended before proceeding to subsequent milestones to ensure a robust, maintainable, and accessible application.

This concludes the QA review for Milestone 2.
